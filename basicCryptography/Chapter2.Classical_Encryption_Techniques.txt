2.1. Symmetric Cipher Model (Mô hình mã hóa đỗi xứng)
- A sysmmetric encryption scheme has 5 ingredients:
	+ Plaintext: the original intelligible message or data -> input
	+ Encryption algorithm: performs various substitutions and transformations on the plaintext
	+ Secret key: value independent of plaintext and algorithm -> input
	+ Ciphertext: scrambled message produced -> output
	+ Decryption algorithm: ciphertext + secret key -> plaintext
- 2 reuirements for secure use of conventional encryption:
	+ The encryption algorithm must be strong: the opponent should be unable to decrypt ciphertext or discover the key even if he or she has a number of ciphertexts together with the plaintext for each ciphertext
	+ Sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key secure. If someone con discover the key and knows the algorithm, all communication using this key is readable
	
- 2.1.1. Cryptography (Mật mã học): Cryptographic system are characterized along 3 independent dimensions:
	+ Type of operations for transforming plaintext to ciphertext
	+ Number of keys used
	+ How the plaintext is processed
	
- 2.1.2. Cryptanalysis (Phân tích mật mã)
Objective of attacking an encryption system: recover the key in use rather then simply to recover the plaintext of single ciphertext. 2 general approaches to attacking a conventional encryption scheme:
	+ Cryptanalysis: rely: nature of algorithm + knowledge of general characteristics of plaintext or some plaintext-ciphertext pair => specific plaintext | key being used
	+ Brute-force attack: tries every possible key

2.2. Substitution Techniques (Phương pháp thay thế)
A substitution technique is one in which the letters of plaintext are replaced by other letter or by numbers or symbols. If the plaintext is viewed as a sequence of bits, then substitution involves replacing plaintext bit patterns with cipher bit pattern

- 2.2.1. Caesar Cipher
+ Earliest and simplest, by Julius Caesar
+ Replace each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing k = 3 places further down the alphabet
+ plain: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
 cipher: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
+ Algorithm:
assign a numerical equivalent to each letter:
a b c d e f g h i j k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

plaintext letter p -> ciphertext letter c
=> c = E(k, p) = (p + k) mod 26
=> d = D(k, c) = (c.k) mod 26

- 2.2.2. Monoalphabetic Ciphers
+ Cipher line can be any permutation of the 26 alphabetic characters => 26! or greater than 4.10^26 possible key
+ Another line of attack

- 2.2.5. Polyalphabetic Ciphers
- 2.2.6. One-Time Pad
